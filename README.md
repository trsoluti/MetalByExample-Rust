# MetalByExample-Rust
Metal By Example sample code implemented mostly in Rust

This code transcribes the code for [MetalByExample](https://github.com/metal-by-example/sample-code) from Objective C to Rust,
leaving the Xcode skeleton so the file can be compiled and signed using Xcode.

As I do more examples, they will be added to this repository.

Eventually, the code will contain both iOS and MacOS versions of each example,
plus a set of useful glue libraries to connect Rust to Objective C code.
